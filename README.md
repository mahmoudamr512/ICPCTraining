The following GitHub repository is just a way to track my progress! Every day, I play to answer 5~20 questions in different Coding websites and using different languages. 

The Following Repo is to track my progress as a student. It doesn't offer the most effecient ways to solve a problems. It shows, however, how much I try to give better answers over time. You may see the same problem VERSIONED. Most of the time, these versions indicate that I have another approach to the same solution!

Below, is a list of the judges I use till now and a description of how the code is organized in every judge: 

1- CodeWars: 

The Katana system on Codewars is amazing. So far, what I practise there is ultimately PHP, Python & C++ (Adding JS soon!).

For PHP: 
        Usually, the problem is written in either OOP format or Functional Formating. Either way, YOU DON'T NEED TO HANDLE THE INPUT READING OPERATION. Unlike other judges, the inpute is given by the judge. You don't need to write READ_DIR or any equivalent function. Usually,
        a copy/paste of my code for any problem is just enough to make it work!
